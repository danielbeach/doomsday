### DoomsDay Clock ###

The ability to calculate the likely hood of a doomsday.

The core is a Scala `doom` calculator that takes input from
data gathered around the web and produces a doom score that
will eventually be feed to a web charting library for display.

The current inputs are ...
 - gold price
 - crude price
 - interest rate
 - news indicator
